<p>Outside CTO&#39;s proprietor is John G. Norman, who serves as the Vice President of
Technology and Information Security at
<a href="https://www.iorahealth.com/">Iora Health</a>. Iora&#39;s tech team has done some
crazy things: It built its own electronic medical records (EHR) system, and
over some nine years only saw a couple of engineers leave. It was built for
the long term, and that&#39;s the kind of intervention John can bring to your
early stage effort.</p>

<p>The creation of Outside CTO was inspired by the example of the company <a href="https://www.outsidegc.com/">Outside GC</a>
(general counsel), which was founded by John&#39;s friend Jon Levitt. An &quot;outside&quot; CTO
provides a different service than that of an &quot;outside&quot; GC, but early stage technical
guidance has always seemed to be a gap in the consulting marketplace.</p>
