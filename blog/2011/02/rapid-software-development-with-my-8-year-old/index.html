We&#39;ve done some Scratch ( <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">http://scratch.mit.edu/</a>) together, and we&#39;ve done some Lego/software integration with MIT&#39;s kit (not Mindstorms -- we used the earlier kit MIT made that doesn&#39;t have Lego branding and so forth). That was pretty fun.</p> <p>But what she really wanted was a multiplication drill-and-practice program. I said to her: &quot;Are you sure?&quot; (because I personally find drill-and-practice dead boring). Well that&#39;s what she wanted. So we did it.</p> <p>We did it in Ruby for my convenience. I decided that the hassles would be worth it. For instance, we talked a lot about what it means to convert a string typed by the human into an integer for the computer&#39;s math. I wrote the code, and explained each and every line to her. The program would show a random multiplication (e.g., &quot;7 x 8 = &quot;), and she would have to type in the answer.</p> <p>Here are the iterations we went through, and my observations regarding kids&#39; games based on this single case:</p> <ol> <li>Report the number correct in a row. She likes the idea of breaking her longest streak of correct answers. <em>Kids like self-created goals.</em> I had introduced the idea of a variable to her earlier, but now we talked about it at greater length, since the counter had to be updated only under certain conditions.</li> <li>Every 5 correct in a row, pop up a funny image. We used some lolcat images from icanhascheezburger.com. <em>My observation here is that kids like frequent rewards. But not too frequent!</em> We allowed that launching the browser to show an image would just be &quot;magic.&quot;</li> <li>She got interested in the basic stats: Number correct, number wrong, percent correct. We talked a lot about percentages, which is a bit ahead of where she is in math. I noticed shortly afterwards that she could correctly predict that if she got the next one right, she&#39;d have 75% correct. <em>To me, this suggests that there are a lot of possibilities for passive learning; she started to &quot;get&quot; percentages without a lot of direction from me.</em> Some of this coding I just did without a lot of explanation: In particular, rounding for the percentages seemed to be too hard for her at this point.</li> <li>As she was doing this, she told me that her goal was to get 100 in a row. At 90, she got one &quot;wrong&quot; because she just pressed return instead of entering a number (a case we hadn&#39;t thought of). We had to stop the program to fix it, but that broke her streak. She suggested that there be some means to go backwards. So we introduced a cheat: If she types &quot;cheat&quot; the most recent answer would be forgotten. <em>This suggests to me that kids love to &quot;win&quot; but at the same time they can become very unhappy if there is a glitch that seems &quot;wrong&quot; to them.</em> Providing a means to get past a &quot;mistake&quot; seems to be very appealing. I am not sure that the availability of &quot;cheats&quot; is a good lesson to teach; it might set up the wrong expectations about the real world. On the other hand, it&#39;s called a &quot;cheat&quot; for good reason, so I encouraged her to feel guilty about using the cheat. We decided to report on the number of cheats used over the course of a game. That way, if she never uses a cheat, she can brag about it (&quot;I got 20 in a row, and didn&#39;t use a cheat!&quot;).</li> <li>Finally, she wanted a bigger payoff at the end. She asked if she could enter her goal (20 in a row), and, if achieved, get a big fat message. So we did that. Now when you get to your goal, it prints out &quot;You Win!&quot; with a lot of asterisks around it. <em>To a kid, a &quot;big&quot; reward is something that is different from the rest of game flow (there are no asterisks elsewhere in the experience).</em></li> </ol> <p>So that was fun. The quality of the technology -- the bells and whistles for the platform -- seemed to matter a lot less than iterating through the game design, and thinking about the right rewards and punishments to encourage sticking to the activity.</p> <div id=disqus_thread></div> <script src="../../../../assets/javascripts/disqus-a273c771.js"></script> <noscript> Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript" rel=nofollow> comments powered by Disqus. </a> </noscript> </div> <hr/> <div class="container-fluid footer-padding px-5"> <aside> <h4>Recent Posts</h4> <ol> <li><a href="../../../2018/05/a-middleman-extension-for-categories/">A Middleman Extension for Categories</a> <span>(May 26, 2018)</span></li> <li><a href="../../../2018/03/hansen-great-at-work-how-top-performers-do-less-work-better-and-achieve-more-book-review/">Hansen, Great at Work&#58; How Top Performers Do Less, Work Better, and Achieve More (Book Review)</a> <span>(March 3, 2018)</span></li> <li><a href="../../../2018/02/transitioning-to-programming/">Transitioning to being a Programmer</a> <span>(February 18, 2018)</span></li> <li><a href="../../../2018/02/values/">Values</a> <span>(February 10, 2018)</span></li> <li><a href="../../../2017/09/fournier-the-manager-s-path-a-guide-for-tech-leaders-navigating-growth-and-change-book-review/">Fournier, The Manager's Path&#58; A Guide for Tech Leaders Navigating Growth and Change (Book Review)</a> <span>(September 2, 2017)</span></li> <li><a href="../../../2017/08/sutherland-scrum-the-art-of-doing-twice-the-work-in-half-the-time-book-review/">Sutherland, Scrum&#58; The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time (Book Review)</a> <span>(August 25, 2017)</span></li> </ol> <h4>Categories</h4> <a href="../../../../category/code/" class="btn btn-default btn-xs">Code <span class='badge badge-secondary'>4</span></a> <a href="../../../../category/iora/" class="btn btn-default btn-xs">Iora <span class='badge badge-secondary'>1</span></a> <a href="../../../../category/kendall-square/" class="btn btn-default btn-xs">Kendall Square <span class='badge badge-secondary'>1</span></a> <a href="../../../../category/management/" class="btn btn-default btn-xs">Management <span class='badge badge-secondary'>1</span></a> <a href="../../../../category/middleman/" class="btn btn-default btn-xs">Middleman <span class='badge badge-secondary'>3</span></a> <a href="../../../../category/rails/" class="btn btn-default btn-xs">Rails <span class='badge badge-secondary'>2</span></a> <a href="../../../../category/reading/" class="btn btn-default btn-xs">Reading <span class='badge badge-secondary'>14</span></a> <a href="../../../../category/reviews/" class="btn btn-default btn-xs">Reviews <span class='badge badge-secondary'>17</span></a> <a href="../../../../category/ruby/" class="btn btn-default btn-xs">Ruby <span class='badge badge-secondary'>6</span></a> <a href="../../../../category/startup-cto-bookshelf/" class="btn btn-default btn-xs">Startup CTO Bookshelf <span class='badge badge-secondary'>2</span></a> <a href="../../../../category/teaching/" class="btn btn-default btn-xs">Teaching <span class='badge badge-secondary'>1</span></a> <a href="../../../../category/technology/" class="btn btn-default btn-xs">Technology <span class='badge badge-secondary'>17</span></a> <a href="../../../../category/uncategorized/" class="btn btn-default btn-xs">Uncategorized <span class='badge badge-secondary'>3</span></a> <a href="../../../../category/values/" class="btn btn-default btn-xs">Values <span class='badge badge-secondary'>1</span></a> <h4>Tags</h4> <a href="/tag/activerecord/" class="btn btn-default btn-xs">activerecord <span class='badge badge-secondary'>1</span></a> <a href="/tag/categories/" class="btn btn-default btn-xs">categories <span class='badge badge-secondary'>1</span></a> <a href="/tag/ruby/" class="btn btn-default btn-xs">ruby <span class='badge badge-secondary'>2</span></a> <a href="/tag/wordpress/" class="btn btn-default btn-xs">wordpress <span class='badge badge-secondary'>2</span></a> <hr/> Check accessibility with <a href="//wave.webaim.org/refer">WAVE</a>. </aside> </div> <footer class=footer> <small class=outsidecto-line-height-smaller> <i>Disclaimer: The views and and opinions expressed in this text belong solely to Outside CTO, LLC, and not to any other group or individual, past, present, or future.
